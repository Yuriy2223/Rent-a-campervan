"Campers for Adventure"

This web application is your portal to the world of comfort on wheels in Ukraine. Created as part of a test challenge, it will help you find the perfect camper for family travel and have fun with us. Now it is ready to impress on desktops with a screen of 1440px and more, so if your monitor does not impress with its size, do not despair - you can still watch it on a small screen, but better on a large one!

 Technologies

React: To create an interface that not only looks cool, but also works fast.
React Router: So that you can easily navigate between pages, and not even lose your way, like in a real trip.
Axios: To interact with the API so that everything you need is loaded quickly, without delays or queues.
Redux: To manage the application's state so it doesn't start behaving like a spoiled child.
MockAPI: To create your own API and save ads for renting campers, instead of making them up yourself.

 Structure

Home: Consider that this could be the first step to wanting to take a campervan trip.
Catalog of campers: A page where you can view all available campers, with the possibility of filtering. Find the right one for your next big adventure.
Favorites: Because everyone has the right to their little dreams and lists of favorites.

The project is already available for viewing. So, sit back and enjoy viewing our luxury camper vans!
